## Resources Required
<!-- TODO: Fill this section below with the resources required to do this sample-->
- `HistogramTest.uds` (Provided as sample data)
- `stb_image_write.h` (Provided in `external`)

## How to use the sample
<!-- TODO: Explain how this sample can be used and what is required to get it running -->
1. Create the project in the sample root directory (see instructions there for more information)
2. Run the sample and observe a UDS is rendered to image with an appropriate shader to file
