## Resources Required
<!-- TODO: Fill this section below with the resources required to do this sample-->
- `HistogramTest.uds` (Provided as sample data)
- `stb_image_write.h` (Provided in `external`)

## How to use the sample
<!-- TODO: Explain how this sample can be used and what is required to get it running -->
1. Create the project in the sample root directory (see instructions there for more information)
2. Set User information in the `VaultSDKFeatureSamples.h` file (if updating a sample, be careful not to push these back upstream)
3. Run the sample and observe a UDS is output from the data provided in CustomConvertTest_ReadFloat
