1. Create the project in the sample root directory (see instructions there for more information)
2. Set User information in the `udSDKFeatureSamples.h` file (if updating a sample, be careful not to push these back upstream)
3. Run the sample with a UDGS .dem path as the first param and (optionally) a texture as the second param and observe a UDS is output from the data is output to UDS
